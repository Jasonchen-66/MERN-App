# Server-Side App

This is the server-side component of our application. It is responsible for handling API requests and serving data to the client-side.

## Getting Started

To run the server, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

1. npm install

   ```bash
   npm install
2. Create a .env file in the server directory to store your MongoDB connection information. Example .env file:

    ```bash
    DB_CONNECT = 
    PASSPORT_SECRET =
    ```

3. Start the server using nodemon:
    ```bash
    nodemon index.js
